## About Me

Iâ€™m a geospatial enthusiast deeply inspired by the beautiful and innovative work of **CraigÂ Taylor**, whose personal site [Mapzilla](https://mapzilla.co.uk/) showcases stunning experiments in 3D data visualization and spatial animation  [oai_citation:0â€¡linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/craig-taylor-78242615_dataviz-3d-map-activity-7252967761671335936-nVRF?utm_source=chatgpt.com) [oai_citation:1â€¡mapzilla.co.uk](https://mapzilla.co.uk/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

I created **Meshscapes** to document my own journeyâ€”collecting learnings, code, and experimentsâ€”for both my future self and anyone interested in transforming geospatial data into animated 3D scenes and printable terrain models.

### ðŸ‘£ Why Meshscapes?

- **Inspired by others**: Craigâ€™s work has had a huge impact on my approach to spatial visualization.
- **Built for learning**: This site is my experimental playgroundâ€”exploring workflows from raw geodata to Blender animation and 3D printing.
- **Shared with community**: Whether you're following along or building upon it, everything here is meant to be accessible, instructive, and open.
